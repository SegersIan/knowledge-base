- **Why it matters**: Breaking the change into smaller, manageable steps reduces resistance and increases the likelihood of success.
- **Example**: Instead of switching entirely to a new CRM system, Jim rolls it out in phases, allowing one team to adopt it first and then gradually expanding to the rest of the company.

---

## 46. **Shoulder to Shoulder**
