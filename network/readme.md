# Networking 101

Summary of network relevant topics regarding computers.

## General Topics

* A **protocol stack** is the collection of protocols (given protocol for each layer) that is used by a given system.
* A **network architecture** is the collection of layers and protocols.
* In networking you have also the concept of a sender sending more than a receiver can handle (like back pressure with streams). In networking this is often named **flow controll**.
* In networking you have often 2 types of delivery
  * **datagram**: Just a stream of data, no need for guarantee of delivery (eg. a stream, video streaming). Usually have a concept of a "connection".
  * **confirmed datagram**: Sent distinct parts, guaranteed delivery. Usually don't talk about a "connection".
* OSI model was created **before** protocols, TCP/Ip **after** protocols. That's why it stuck more and had no "flaws" for new use cases.

## Introduction OSI model

* **OSI:** Open Systems Interconnection Model
  * Standardizes communication functions of telecommunication/computer systems with standard communication protocols.
  * Original model defines 7 abstraction layers.
  * A layer servers the layer above and served by the layer below.
  * ISO standard
  * Each level has a **PDU**, Protocol Data Unit (e.g. Data, Package, Segment, Frame, ...)
  * A PDU has a **payload** (Service Data Unit, SDU) + protocol related header and footer.
  * Some protocols might define "sublayers" for the benefit of the protocol design.
  * Just a model, nothing in the real world adhere's to it.
  
* Communication protocols enable an entity in one host to interact with corresponding entity at the same layer in another host.
* Some layers allow variable length of data, but lower layers might have to adhere to fixed length. These layers will split the data into smaller parts.

* The 7 Layers
  * Layer 1: **Physical** - Transmission of raw data between devices over a medium. Converts bits to electric/radio or optical signals.
  * Layer 2: **Data Link** - Node to node transfer. Detects/corrects errors in physical layer. Defines protocol to establish and terminate connections between physical devices + flow control. (e.g. 802.11 Wi-Fi)
  * Layer 3: **Network** - Functional and procedural means of transferring variable length packets from one node to another in different networks. At this point there is a concept of "address" for each node and a packet can be "routed". At this point the packet does not travel perse between 2 devices that are physically directly connected. More details later.
  * Layer 4: **Transport** - Functional and procedural means of transferring variable length packets from source to destination while maintaining QoS functions. This is end-to-end at this point. You talk with the target device, not an in between node. 
  * Layer 5: **Session** - Controls (establish, manage and terminate) connections between computers. Provides full-duplex, half-duplex and simplex operation. RPCs usually live on this layer.
  * Layer 6: **Presentation** - Establish context between application-layer entities. Translates between network and application formats. So translates data into the format that he application layer accepts. Layer can also include compression functions.
  * Layer 7: **Application** - Layer closest to end user, communicating with the software application.
  
* Cross-layer functions: Services not tied to a given layer, may affect multiple layers (e.g. security).

* Comparison with TCP/IP model:
  * Internet Application Layer: Maps to OSI's Application (#7), Presentation (#6) and Session Layer (#5).
  * TCP/IP Transport Layer: Graceful close functions of OSI Session (#5) and Transport layer (#4).
  * Internet Layer: OSI Network Layer (#3)
  * Link Layer: OSI Data Link Layer (#2) and Phsyical Layer (#1)
  * Notice how OSI Session layer relates to Internet Application and Transport layer of TCP/IP.
  
* A layer has a "Service" which is the primitives/operations that it exposes to the higher level layer using our given layer, see it as the interface. The protocol is rather the rules for a the same layer but between different machines, the peer layers. (e.g. how is the data structured for given layer)

## Introduction TCP/IP Model

* The 4 Layers
  * Layer 1: **Physical** - The model does not specify much about this layer. As long it can serve the upper layer.
  * Layer 2: **Network/Internet** - The routing logic from end2end across multiple nodes. Connection-agnostic layer. Defines an official packet format and protocol, named **IP** (internet protocol).
  * Layer 3: **Transport** - Layer allows peer entities to have conversations with source and target entities.
    * 2 end2end protocols available on this level
      * **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol) - Delivery guarantee, reassembled out of order messages. Also does control flow.
      * **UDP** (User datagram Protocol) - No delivery guarantee, connectionless, stream basically. Also for single request/reply queries. Speed is more important than accuracy.
  * Layer 4: **Application** - Experiende said that abstractions of session/presentation layers were not necessary. Examples are TELNET, FTP, SMTP, HTTP, DNS, NNTP, ...)
  
* Compared to OSI model
  * Layer 1: **Physical** - Encapsulates "Physical" layer and "Data Link" layer of ISO
  * Layer 2: **Network/Internet** - Same as "Network" layer of ISO
  * Layer 3: **Transport** - Same as "Transport" layer of ISO
  * Layer 4: **Application** - Encapsulates "Session", "Presentation", and "Application" layer of ISO
