# Wisdom

> Best way to get feedback or an answer, by posting a wrong answer

> Comparison is the mental thief of joy

> The best thing you can do with a good reputation is squander it, because you can’t take it with you when you’re dead.

> Your problem and challenges are not unique - find others that solved it

> Always assume good intent

> Just do it, don't ask for permission, people will resist or take things from you away if you're doing a bad job.

> Define the role you want, don't fill in that they say.

> A talent for following the ways of yesterday, is not sufficient to improve the world of today

> “a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its shoes”

> Easy and Fast is what allows for innovation.

> Focus on productivity first and portability second. If you're not productive (and your competitors are), you'll have nothing to port.

> Business plans that describe how you would capture a small slice of a vast market are the first ones to go into the trash bin. Instead, we look for ideas that serve one market better than anyone else in that market.

## Leadership / Influence
> Usually, you might have good ideas, but listen to everyone first, then “hey, at least 3 of you said we should do x, what do you think?”.
> You might have planted some ideas before, (read how) but then make sure they feel they were part of the decision. This will give more buy in and conviction.
> Remember the expensive consultant example. An good consultant just surfaces the ideas of those who are there and know it without taking credit.
> Do a listening tour
> This is an example of a leader that pulls, instead of pushing (telling what to do). So pulling doesn’t mean “say what to do and then step along”, no.
