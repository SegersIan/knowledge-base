# Quick Select

* This is good for searching a "second lowest" value or such, not for sorting.
* Uses partitioning
* Kind of a hybrid of Quicksort and binary search.

* We first partition
* We have the pivot in place
* Now we use the binary search approach by ignoring all the values after or before the pivot, depending what your searching for.
