# Career

## General Tips

* “Let me take care of that” are the golden words to tell someone. Disregarding the size of it. You will get noticed for taking care of things, that attitude, and getting things done.
* Communication and networking are the true difficult skills that create impact.

## Discover your skills

* Make a list of projects, efforts, initiatives or roles you were a part of.
* Write for each list item what you did, how it went, what impact it had, what side effects and positives. Consider adding any "lessons learned".
* Now ask yourself for each list item "What skills did I apply to make this happen?".
* Now you have a "skill inventory" and examples of where you applied all of these skills.
* Now go through each skill in your skill inventory and write down, following the STAR method, an example of how you applied this skill. Note that you now can take the examples of previous steps, and you just need to rephrase them into the STAR template.
* Now you got a skill inventory and STAR based "stories" that can illustrate these skills.

## When Applying

* When you write a cover letter, consider which skills are key to sell in that cover letter, use your skill inventory's stories to pick the right stories.
* When you are invited for an interview, read over your skill inventory, so you can easily use these prepared stories/examples to answer questions and proof competence.
