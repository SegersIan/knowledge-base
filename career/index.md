## General Tips

* “Let me take care of that” are the golden words to tell someone. Disregarding the size of it. You will get noticed for taking care of things, that attitude, and getting things done.
* Communication and networking are the true difficult skills that create impact.

### Brag Document / Work Log

Keep document that you continuously amend (like a diary) where you track your smaller and greater achievements and successes at work. This allows you to:
* Reflect on your achievements
* Have a documented track record of you achievements
* Share with your leadership your achievements at any given time (especially during performance reviews and salary renegotiations), remember, your leadership is usually not fully aware of all the work you do and results deliver.
* Reflect on what skills you have or gained ([see Discover your skills](#discover-your-skills) on a more details)
* Share during a job interview or job applications about relevant achievements that are relevant for the job.
* Look back and be proud of what you have achieved.

Try to update the document **once every week or two.**

### Discover your traits & personality

* Make a list of your personality and traits
* Use this list to write down what you like and don't like
* From this, try to write down an understanding of the type of jobs/roles you want and don't want.
* We will use this in our job search.

* **TIP**: *Personality tests, friends, family and (former) coworkers can always help you make that list.*

### Discover your skills

* Make a list of projects, feedback from (former) co-workers, efforts, initiatives or roles you were a part of.
* Write for each list item what you did, how it went, what impact it had, what side effects and positives. Consider adding any "lessons learned".
* Now ask yourself for each list item "What skills did I apply to make this happen?".
* Now you have a "skill inventory" and examples of where you applied all of these skills.
* Now go through each skill in your skill inventory and write down, following the STAR method, an example of how you applied this skill. Note that you now can take the examples of previous steps, and you just need to rephrase them into the STAR template.
* Now you got a skill inventory and STAR based "stories" that can illustrate these skills.
* **TIP**: *You can always contact (former) co-workers to answer a small survey about you that can help identify your skills.*

## The Job Journey

### When Applying

* When you write a cover letter, consider which skills are key to sell in that cover letter, use your skill inventory's stories to pick the right stories.
* When you are invited for an interview, read over your skill inventory, so you can easily use these prepared stories/examples to answer questions and proof competence.

### The Job Search Process

* Understand what type of jobs/roles you want and don't want (see [Traits](#discover-your-traits--personality)).
* Search for jobs that describe what you want by paying attention to the "responsibilities" section and the general description.
* Make a short list of jobs that you want to apply to.

### The Job Application Process

* Using your traits & personality 
* Once you have a job you want to apply for...
* Read through the job ad and highlight any references to skills.
    * Pay especially attention to the "qualifications" and "responsibilities" section.
* Now you have mapped out all the "desired" skills.
* Tailor your CV to match all these "desired" skills with the skill you have. Making sure they mention it and the same writing.
* Write the cover letter where you talk a bit about yourself, what makes you unique, your personality ([Traits](#discover-your-traits--personality)) without, and then pick 1 to 3 stories of your skill inventory to show the top skills you think that are key for this position. Illustrating why you are a good match.
* Submit
* Before you have an interview, read through your [skill inventory](#discover-your-skills) to freshen up these "stories" for each skill.
* Now you are prepared to respond to any questions about your skills with a well prepared example to illustrate your competence.
