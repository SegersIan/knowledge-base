## General Tips

* “Let me take care of that” are the golden words to tell someone. Disregarding the size of it. You will get noticed for taking care of things, that attitude, and getting things done.
* Communication and networking are the true difficult skills that create impact.
* Your network determines your influence and (potential) impact. Network! Within your organization there should is no reason to not reach out to other employees for a coffee chat/meet-n-greet.

### Brag Document / Work Log

Keep document that you continuously amend (like a diary) where you track your smaller and greater achievements and successes at work. This allows you to:
* **Reflect on your achievements and how you spend your time at work.**
    * What work do you feel most proud of?
    * What do I wish to do more/less off?
    * Which projects hade the effect I wanted ? Or not ?
    * What can I do better next time?
    * What did I struggle with?
    * How can I grow?
    * What is the impact of my work?
    * How am I doing regarding any goals I set for myself?
* **Have a documented track record of you achievements**
* **Share with your leadership your achievements** at any given time (especially during performance reviews and salary renegotiations), remember, your leadership is usually not fully aware of all the work you do and results deliver.
    * When the time comes for a performance review, your memory might draw blank and you have little memory of the work you did.
    * Your manager also manages other people, they will not remember all of your work.
    * Good data gives your manager the tools to justify to others your promotion or salary increase.
    * When you get a new manager a few months before the big performance review, they won't have any knowledge about your recent work.
* **Reflect on what skills you have or gained** ([see Discover your skills](#discover-your-skills) on a more details)
* **Share during a job interview** or job applications about relevant achievements that are relevant for the job.
* **Look back and be proud of what you have achieved.**

Try to update the document **once every week or two**, but eventually find a frequency that works for you, but allows you to not forget any relevant topics.

#### Important

* Consider documenting also **the little things** you do, now you can reflect on how you spend time at work.
    * Code Reviews, making a process easier, create more automation.
* Consider documenting the **direct impact** for each of the things you write down, now you can reflect on the impact of your work.
    * Maybe you spend a lot of time spend on low impact work. Not ideal!
* Consider documenting anything **quantifiable through metrics**, insights, KPIs, now you can quantify the impact of your work.
* Consider documenting and **side effects, n-tier impact** of your work. Maybe your work has resulted in shorter sales cycles for the company, as a result of your automation project which allows for faster building of PoC's.
    * Think about business areas and processes that gained advantage.
    * Did it save any money? Did it generate any money?
    * It's really great for yourself and when talking to others, to know how have an impact on more than your direct surrounding.
* Consider documenting what you have learned of which skills you gained or honed during certain work.

### Discover your traits & personality

* Make a list of your personality and traits
* Use this list to write down what you like and don't like
* From this, try to write down an understanding of the type of jobs/roles you want and don't want.
* We will use this in our job search.

* **TIP**: *Personality tests, friends, family and (former) coworkers can always help you make that list.*

### Discover your skills

* Make a list of projects, feedback from (former) co-workers, efforts, initiatives or roles you were a part of.
* Write for each list item what you did, how it went, what impact it had, what side effects and positives. Consider adding any "lessons learned".
    * Don't forget about your [Brag Document](#brag-document--work-log) which would be your natural place to go.
* Now ask yourself for each list item "What skills did I apply to make this happen?".
* Now you have a "skill inventory" and examples of where you applied all of these skills.
* Now go through each skill in your skill inventory and write down, following the STAR method, an example of how you applied this skill. Note that you now can take the examples of previous steps, and you just need to rephrase them into the STAR template.
* Now you got a skill inventory and STAR based "stories" that can illustrate these skills.
* **TIP**: *You can always contact (former) co-workers to answer a small survey about you that can help identify your skills.*

## The Job Journey

### When Applying

* When you write a cover letter, consider which skills are key to sell in that cover letter, use your skill inventory's stories to pick the right stories.
* When you are invited for an interview, read over your skill inventory, so you can easily use these prepared stories/examples to answer questions and proof competence.

### The Job Search Process

    * Pay especially attention to the "qualifications" and "responsibilities" section.
* Now you have mapped out all the "desired" skills.

* Write the cover letter where you talk a bit about yourself, what makes you unique, your personality ([Traits](#discover-your-traits--personality)) without, and then pick 1 to 3 stories of your skill inventory to show the top skills you think that are key for this position. Illustrating why you are a good match.
* Submit
