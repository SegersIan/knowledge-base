Yes, several companies have documented their approach to using an internal open-source model, sharing their methods, challenges, and best practices. Here are a few examples where you can read more about how companies have embraced and documented their internal open-source approaches:

### 1. **Google's Engineering Practices**
   - **Internal Open Source (Borg, Blaze/Bazel)**: Google has been known for encouraging an internal open-source culture, particularly with their monorepo and toolchains like Blaze (open-sourced as Bazel). While the entire organization contributes to shared code, teams are given ownership over specific parts. Google has published their approach in various white papers and engineering blog posts.

### 2. **Spotify's Squad Model and Open-Source Philosophy**
   - Spotify is well-known for using a "squad" model where autonomous teams (squads) work on different parts of their products. They've documented their use of internal open-source principles, where different squads contribute to shared codebases and use tools like GitHub internally.
   - **Read more**: Spotify Engineering Culture [Part 1 and Part 2](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/) discuss their organizational structure and open-source mindset.

### 3. **Microsoft's InnerSource Initiative**
   - Microsoft has embraced internal open-source practices under the term "InnerSource." InnerSource refers to the application of open-source principles inside an organization, and Microsoft has documented their approach to collaboration and governance across teams, especially since they have moved towards a more open and cross-collaborative culture post-2014.
