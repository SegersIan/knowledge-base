# A list of Architecture Characteristics

Characteristics describe our desired behaviour of a system across different dimensions. it is important to understand the desired characteristics and to make an explicit commitment to them. A system must not comply or concern itself about all the possible Architecture Characteristics that we can think of, cause for each system, this will differ.

What is important, is that a conscious and explicit decision is made of what Architecture Characteristics are important for given system. In addition these decisions must be clear and prefferabily quantifiable so it is easy to asses of the system complies with desired characteristics or not.
