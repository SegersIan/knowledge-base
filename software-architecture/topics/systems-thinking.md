# Systems Thinking

## Definition

> A "system" in systems thinking is a set of interconnected elements, which can be subsystems in their own right, organized within defined boundaries. These elements function cohesively to achieve a common purpose or produce specific outcomes, influenced by the system's structure and internal interactions.

* **Interconnected Elements**: A system contains one or many elements which are interconnected.
* **Can be subsystems in their own right**: Any element can be a high level abstraction of a whole system of its own.
* **Organized within defined boundaries**: A system as clear, set boundaries, anything outside the boundaries is not a part of the system. However, a boundary can be adjacent to other systems which the systems is interconnected to.
* **Elements function cohesively to achieve a common purpose or produce specific outcomes**: The structure and behavior of these interconnected elements produce certain outcome.

The concept of a "system" can be applied to pretty much anything around us. The human bod is a 


For a System we can find a definition like:

> a set of things working together as parts of a mechanism or an interconnecting network; a complex whole.

Or more specifically for Software Systems:

> System software is a set of generalized programs that manage the resources of the computer, such as the central processing unit, communication links, and peripheral devices

However, as you will read further about *Evolutionary Architecture* you might understand why I personally like to keep the following definition.:

> a group of body organs that together perform one or more vital functions

Lastly, if we look at physics, we can also see the usage of the term:

> The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed - only converted from one form of energy to another. This means that a system always has the same amount of energy, unless it's added from the outside.

Either way, a **System** is a concept, far more general than software/IT systems. There is a field of [Systems Thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking). If you want to read more about it, I suggest [Thinking in Systems: A Primer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking_In_Systems:_A_Primer).

Keep in mind, a system can exist out of smaller systems or be a part of a bigger system. Usually a system has also adjacent systems. Deciding on what parts you consider to include in your "view" of the system is important and challenging.
