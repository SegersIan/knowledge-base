## Dealing with the large stream of information

Try to find a system that works for you, cause you can't change the fact that there WILL be a large stream of information coming your way.

You can consider using David Allen's "Getting things Done" approach:

* **Drop** means read, understand, and then archive. It’s what you use for anything that doesn’t require any action on your part.
   * Always archive, never delete.
* **Delegate** is for things that do require action, but not from you. Make sure that it gets to the right person and is understood by them, and make a note for follow-up. It can be someone you report to, reports to you or even outside that line.
   * ***Within your own team*, you only ever delegate tasks, not responsibility.**
   * Find the right person that can get the task done.
   * Preemptively send them all the information that you think they might need (and that you have access to), rather than relying on them to ask.
   * Ask them to acknowledge that they have received what they need.
   * Make a note to follow up to see if they need anything else, and follow through by seeing the task to completion.
* **Defer** means it needs doing, and it’s you who needs to do it, but it doesn’t need doing immediately. Enter it into your task list, and clear it from your inbox.
   * Add the task immediately to some sort of queue (for email, this can be a folder named “Needs Reply”),
   * Make sure to go through that queue at a later time to prioritize,
   * Absolutely ensure that you make time to go back and actually do your prioritized tasks, at a time you consider convenient.
* **Do** are the (typically very few) things that remain that need to be done by you, and immediately.
   * Tell people that you’re doing them, because you’ll want to be uninterrupted. Update your chat status, put some blocked time in your calendar.
   * Make sure you’ll be uninterrupted. For email, turn off all your notifications.
   * Plow through all the undropped, undelegated, undeferred items in your inbox until it’s empty.
