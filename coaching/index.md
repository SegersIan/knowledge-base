# Coaching

In the coaching process you have a "Coach", the one who coaches, and the "Client", the one who is being coached.

Coaching does not involve telling clients what to do but empowers them to find their own solutions.

## What It Is
Coaching is a developmental process where a coach supports someone in achieving specific personal or professional goals by providing guidance, feedback, and encouragement. It involves active listening, questioning, and facilitating self-discovery to help clients enhance their skills, overcome challenges, and maximize their potential. Coaching is goal-oriented, collaborative, and focused on the client's strengths and future aspirations.

## What It Is Not
It is not therapy or counseling, which deal with resolving past issues and emotional problems, nor is it consulting, where the expert provides specific solutions and advice.

## "The Coaching Habbit"

This is a coaching strategy by Micheal Bungay Stanier, based on 7 type's questions to use during coaching. This strategy is more for coaching people around you and help them, rather than helping someone progress in their career or such. Nevertheless, many of these questions are reusable tools for communicating and coaching in general.

* 1. **The Kickstart Question**: "What's on your mind?"
  * This turns your conversation into a real conversation.
* 2. **The AWE Question**: "And What Else?"
* 3. **The Focus Question**: "What's the real challenge here for you?"
* 4. **The Foundation Question**: "What do you want?"
* 5. **The Lazy Question**: "How can I help?"
* 6. **The Strategic Question**: "If you're saying yes to this. what are you saying no to?"
* 7. **The Learning Question**: "What was most useful for you?"

### Reasons To Coach

* **Decrease Overdependence**: People can become dependent on you if you usually provide answers, with coaching you make them less dependend on your to find their answers and solutions. Making everyone more selfsufficient and growing. Now you are not the bottleneck anymore.
* **Dont get overwhelmed**: By making others selfsufficient, you get more time again and less workload.
* **Become More Connected**: You will be more connected to work that matters again and also with the poeople you have coached.
