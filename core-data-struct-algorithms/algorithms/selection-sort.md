# Selection Sort

* Algorithm
  * Point to the first cell.
  * Search through all the following items which one has the lowest value.
  * After having search through all the following items, swap the values from the pointed cell with the lowest value.
  * Move the pointer to the next cell on the right, start over again, (new passthrough starts)

* Efficiency is O(N2 / 2), but as we ignore constants O(N2), so same as the bubble sort in worth case.
