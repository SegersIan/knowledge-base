## General Concepts

### The 3 Cybersecurity Objectives

* **CIA** Triad == The 3 Objectives/goals
  * **Confidentiality** - No unauthorized individual is able to access sensitive information.
  * **Integrity** - No unauthorized changes to systems or data.
  * **Availability** - Informations and systems are ready to meet the needs of legitimate users at the time those users request them.
* 1 Additional goal/objective
  * **Nonrepudiation** - Someone who performs some action, cannot later deny having taken that action.

### Security Incident

* When there is a breach of any of the CIA Triad goals.
  * Tip: Security therefore is not only about dangerous individuals, but also events like an earthquake.

### The 3 Cybersecurity Threats

* **DAD** Triad
  * Disclosure (aka data loss) <-> Confidentiality violation
    * Data exfiltration (the act of moving data outside the intended organization/boundaries)
  * Alteration <-> Integrity violation
  * Denial <-> Availability violation

### Breach Impact

Types of impact when a security incident happens.

* **Financial** - Equipment broken, new datacenter, loss of revenue, ...
* **Reputational** - Negative publicity
* **Strategic** - IP that allows competition to act faster, outsmart you, copy you, ...
* **Operational** - inability to do day-to-day functions, slow down business processes, ...
* **Compliance** - violating a legal or regulatory requirement (e.g. HIPAA)
