# Thinking and Reasoning

## Thinking

Thinking is any mental activity that helps formulate or solve a problem, make a decision, or fulfill a desire to understand. It is searching for answers, and reaching for meaning.

To be a succesful problem solver, you will need both factual knowledge and proficiency in thinking.

## Nature of reasoning
* Reasoning is a skill in using thought and language, and it is profficiency in this skill, not the mere possesion of language, which distinguishes the human species from the others on this planet.
* Reasoning has function to help us find answers to our problems.
* Reasoning has funcfion to express reasons in publicly accessible language.
* Publicly accessible language means that it must be easily accessible or understandble to others.
* The emphasis on communication, on the crucial importance of the **social activity of reasoning**, means that we can **scarecely afford any jargon** at all.
  * Different texts might use different terminology.

* Reading without understand = Basic Reasoning
* Rational = Reasonable
* Practice is more valuable than theory on Reasoning, it's like language, there is no adequate grammar, it changes, you have to use it, just like learning a language.

## Argument Analysis

* 3.2
  * Inconcistency Types
    * Logical Inconsistency: Can be detected by anyone who speakers the language without other special knowledge. (aka Contradiction)
    * Factual Inconsistency: A logical inconsistency between what is said (Antwerp is near Oslo) and an unstated fact (Antwerp is in Belgium, but that's a fact or special knowledge that you need to spot the inconsistency).
    * Improbable/Implausible/Quasi-Inconsistent: Something described of having 2 properties which are almost certainly incompatible (that dress is overall green and overall red, but certain materials can be that based on light conditions ).
  * Contradiction == logical inconsistency
  * Consistency is a requirement of communication. Avoid inconsistency/contradiction is crucial.
  * The main point of argument presentation is to show that some kind of inconcistency or implausability is involved in *accepting the premises* of the argument and *rejecting the conclusion*.
  * Arguments are meant to be persuasive; and they succeed in being persuasive if they begin with assertions that the listener or reader is known to accept, and if they continue by showing that acceptance of those asserts (which are called the premises of the argument) requires the acceptance of the conclusion.
  * The power of an argument depends upon two things:
    * It should start off with premises that are known to be true or can be shown to be true.
    * It should proceed to demonstrate or exhibit the way which these premises "force" one to accept the conclusion(s).
      * The force of whishing to avoid contradiction/inconsistency if a weaker kind.
  * You start with a premis (things the other accept) and then steps (aka the inference) that built towards a conclusion. If someone disagrees but agrees with the premsie, they must rebunte one of the steps.
    * You are 18 years old (premise), men below age 25 don't have fully matured brains (step/inference 1) according to sience, so you are not fully mature (Conclusion),
  * Argument types
    * Deductive argument - Logical deduction (e.g. arithmics showing how much something costs, including hidden costs) - Easy attacked with facts or newer facts
    * Inductive argument - Statistical/probable (e.g. its very likely interest rate will increase next month, because ...) - Harder to attack, cause it's implied it's not factual, but likely.
  * Inconsistency is great attack/weapon if poeople have no interest to communicate.
