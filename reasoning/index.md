# Thinking and Reasoning

## Thinking

Thinking is any mental activity that helps formulate or solve a problem, make a decision, or fulfill a desire to understand. It is searching for answers, and reaching for meaning.

To be a succesful problem solver, you will need both factual knowledge and proficiency in thinking.

## Nature of reasoning
* Reasoning is a skill in using thought and language, and it is profficiency in this skill, not the mere possesion of language, which distinguishes the human species from the others on this planet.
* Reasoning has function to help us find answers to our problems.
* Reasoning has funcfion to express reasons in publicly accessible language.
* Publicly accessible language means that it must be easily accessible or understandble to others.
* The emphasis on communication, on the crucial importance of the **social activity of reasoning**, means that we can **scarecely afford any jargon** at all.
  * Different texts might use different terminology.

* Reading without understand = Basic Reasoning
* Rational = Reasonable
* Practice is more valuable than theory on Reasoning, it's like language, there is no adequate grammar, it changes, you have to use it, just like learning a language.
