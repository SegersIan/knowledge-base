## How to Lie with statistics

### The Sample With the Built-In Bias

When there is a poll or statistic, one must scrutinize the sample which was used to calculate the statistic. Getting an unbiased sample is extremely hard or near to impossible?

Example: The avg salary of a Yale student of the 1924 graduate is now earning 25000 Dollar/Year. Did they send a questionnaire to all students (did they have their address), maybe those who they don't have the address of are the super successful, or they all passed away and so on. Next, those with known addresses are now already a biased set that might miss out on significant higher or lower earners. How many respond? Maybe 10% ? What differentiates the onces who feel like responding from the others? When they do respond, are they being honest. People dare to lie , a lot, on questionnaires, interviews and poll. Consciously or subconsciously.

Just going on the street and interview people is biased, based on the place, time and maybe who the interviewers feels attracted to.

**A purely random sample is hard, almost impossible to come by. Ask yourself how a sample can be biased.**
