# Game Storming

Gamestorming is a collaborative approach to problem-solving and innovation that uses structured games to help groups think creatively, communicate more effectively, and explore complex challenges together. By combining elements of play, visual thinking, and facilitated activities, gamestorming creates an engaging environment where participants can generate ideas, uncover insights, and align around shared understanding. Rather than relying on abstract discussions, it encourages hands-on participation, making thinking visible and helping teams break down assumptions, discover new perspectives, and move from exploration to actionable outcomes.

## Making Not-Knowing Desirable

> Chapter 1.

Create conditions in which humans venture into new spaces of possibility. Temporarily exchanging certainty for doubt in order to unlock collaboration, problem solving, agility, imagination, innovation and boundless adventure. There are **5 game storming features** that help unlock these.

* **Thinking Moves** - Meta-cognitive processes through which we better understand and engage with the world.
    * When done well: new resources, knowledge acquisition, breakthroughs, and surprising solutions.
    * Examples
        * *Reason With Evidence*
        * *Make Connections*
        * *Uncover Complexity*
        * *Capture The Essence*
        * *Build Explanations*
        * *Describe What's Here*
        * *Wonder*
        * *Consider Different Views*
        * *Identify Patterns*
        * *Generate Possibilities*
        * *Evaluate Evidence*
        * *Make Plans*
        * *Identify Assumptions/Bias*
        * *Prioritize/Rank*
* **Thinking Beyond The Brain** - Refers to the idea that effective thinking is not limited to what happens silently inside an individual’s mind, but is enhanced through physical, visual, and social interaction. In gamestorming activities, participants externalize their thoughts by sketching, moving objects, writing on sticky notes, and interacting with others, which reduces cognitive load and reveals patterns that might otherwise remain hidden. This approach leverages the body, space, and group dynamics as part of the thinking process, allowing ideas to evolve through shared artifacts and collective sense-making rather than isolated mental effort.
* **Visualization** - Gives immediate access to what's inside of other people's space. Sketches make the invisible, visible. Internalized knowledge becomes externalized.
* **Games** - Powerful and purposeful thought experiments.
* **Games Sequences** - We might want to pipe different games to build a bigger journey.

## A Game

> Chapter 2.

* **Game Components**
    * *Game Space* - A alternative world, a model world. Ordinary life is suspended and other rules apply. (just like with DD)
    * *Boundaries* - In space and time. There is a time where the game starts and ends. Usually the game happens in a space, if outside, you step outside the game. (I go to the toilet)
    * *Rules For Interaction* - The rules of engagement, interaction, etc.
    * *Artifacts* - Board, post-its, ball, chess board and pieces, anything you might need/use for the game.
    * *Goal* - When is the game over? End state. Something understood by all players.
