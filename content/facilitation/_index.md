# Facilitation

Facilitation is the process of guiding and managing group activities, discussions, or meetings to ensure effective participation, clear communication, and achievement of objectives. It involves creating an environment that encourages collaboration, creativity, and productivity among participants.

* Facilitation is about helping groups get better results.
* Groups are often less than the sum of their parts, facilitating aims to reduce that.

## Training, Mentoring, Group Coaching and Facilitation

They all differ, pick the one applicable to your use case.

| Type | Who controls what is being learned | Type of Participation | Comments |
| ---  | ---                                | ---                   | ---     |
| Facilitating | The Group                  | Facilitator + entire group | Good for collaborative learning |
| Teaching | Educator primarily             | Mostly from educator, little from group | |
| Lecturing | Educator solely               | Solely from educator | More if a clear message/topic must be transferred |

## Effective Decisions

> ED (Effective Decision) = RD (Right Decision) x CD (Commitment to the Decision)

Usually we make a (right) decisions but then must built up commitment. With a good facilitation you get commitment as the right solution is built. Therefore, more effective decisions.


## Facilitation Types

* **Experiential Facilitation**: Facilitate experiences for people to learn by doing. Also known as adventure or outdoor education.
    * Examples: Conflict resolution, Communication, and problem solving.
* **Dialogue Facilitation**: Building bridges rather than walls.
    * Examples: Put strangers in a circle and talk about given topic(s) (e.g. Politics, Race, Opinions)
* **General Facilitation**: More like in business, run a meeting. A general batch, but skills from Experiential and Dialogue facilitation can help tremendously. Most of these notes are about this.

## The Facilitator

### Role

1. I create the container. The participants create the content.
2. My actions enforce their self-organization.
3. It's their meeting. Not Mine.
4. Meetings are real work (Good facilitator required).
5. Success = a fulfilled purpose.

#### Notes
* When being the facilitator, you can't focus on the content and your own opinion.
* Don't tempt to become the project owner/manager.
* As facilitator you can/must push action item commitment.
* Fall back to the excuse "as facilitator it's my role to ...." to allow for pushing certain things that are about the process, not the actual content!
* Evokes creativity and confidence in the group
* Honest & Transparent : I see "this" is happening, in a meta way you observe, less about the content, as facilitator you can be 100% content agnostic.
* Ground and calm
* Adaptive designer: Design a plan, but can be adaptive when necessary based on the needs.
* Clarity: Your instructions and guidance must be clear, else people will get lost.
    * **F.O.G.S:** Framing, Objective, Guidelines and Safety - A framework for clarity. [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cVGI0wo23M)
        * **Framing**: Situate the context. You got to change the context and make it relevant for everybody.
            * Example: Share a story that leads into the purpose or objective of whatever you're doing.
        * **Objective**: Clarify/share a clear object for given activity or whole session
            * Example: "Share (personal) stories, without sharing opinions" - now a clear objective was set
        * **Guidelines**: Rules of engagement. Sometimes adding rules makes your gathering better.
        * **Safety**: Try to increase both
            * Physical: If people gonna be running around, make it safe to do so.
            * Psychological: People who run meetings often don't mention this type of safety. A highly functional team has a high degree of psychological safety.

### Do and Don't

* Do:
    * Carefully assess needs
    * Stay neutral
    * Have a lot of tools
    * Create open trusting atmosphere and tell why everyone is there.
    * Simple & direct language
    * Conclude meetings on positive notes.
    * Clear steps
    * Clarity in general
* Don't:
    * Be center of attention
    * Not check in with participants
    * Not listen
    * Too passive
    * Lose track of ideas
    * Put people down
    * Not take breaks
    * Not have alternative approaches to adjust
    * Let discussions go one and on

### Characteristics

* Authenticity:
* Organizer
* Look-Out
* Orchestrator
* Guide
* Conflict Solver
* Active Listener
     * The way that you listen has the power to change what you say. This includes body language. The more "listening" and positive the body language (e.g. lean in) the more they will share.
* Coach

## Activities & Types

And event is made up of activities, there are many variations, but they all try to achieve a certain goal. We can categorize these types based on the goal they try to reach.

* **Energizer**: Get blood flowing and get everyone mentally in the room again.
    * Help to return the focus and energy.
    * When too many participants, split in groups, of that shortens the total time of the energizer activity (e.g. playing a game)
    * Be weary of physical energizers, make sure the room is safe and clean.
    * A check-in could ben an energizer also.
* **List**: List facts, known things, statements, limitations.
* **Brainstorm**: Collect and idea new ideas.
* **Group**: Group ideas that are very similar.
* **Prioritize**: Prioritize/group items to decided what gets attention first or not at all.
* **Commit**: Have participants commit to actions.

        * My key takeaways?
        * Most memorable statement made by fellow participant?
        * Did we reach our objectives
            * Visual TIP: Create one dimensional scale from "not at all" to "oh yeah" and let people drop a "dot" on the scale. So you get immediately a visual concentration.

### Prioritize

* **Description**:

        * Get Preference from participants
            * Voting (suggested rule: 20% of votes vs the amount of items)
            * Move some dots
        * Use Logic with Eisenhower Matrix
* **Why**:
    * Need to decide which topics/items to focus on (take only top 3)
    * Need to decide which topics/items to focus first on

#### People who dominate conversation

* Flip The Role: Pretext your question with a request for the busy talkers to hold of. People who talk a lot know they talk a lot.
    * Example: "Hey, if you're typically one of the first people to speak, please hold back and wait to be one of the last (or 3th) to speak, is is possible might not get a chance to speak this time,  but I'd love to hear some of the  voices that not always get heard."
    * This is less directed towards individuals (e.g. hey Mark, I didn't hear you yet.)
* Creating Space: Create more space/silence for those who are a bit more hesitant to speak, to get their chance.
    * To avoid awkward silence to create productive silence. Build on top of the "Flip The Role" , by also pretexting, that you want a specific time window before anyone answers, so every can think for a moment.
    * Example: "Hey, if you're typically one of the first people to speak, please hold back and wait to be one of the last (or 3th) to speak, is is possible might not get a chance to speak this time,  but I'd love to hear some of the  voices that not always get heard. I am going to ask this question, and then pause in total silence for 5 seconds to wait for everyone to think of their own response before we share."
    * Even if the 5 seconds pass, let them take the time.
* Change the mechanics: Domination could be because of the people, but because of the structure of the meeting.
    * Split out into groups to have discussions (breakout sessions) and then report back what you heard other people in your group say (not what you said).
* Steering into the curve: Address the elephant in the room, address this privately first. This is more closer to "last resort" if others don't work.
    * Pull person aside: What I'd love you to do, I love all your contributions and I am recognizing your contributions are heavier than others and I'd like to make space for voices. Can you aim to bear through this awkward silence to give space to other people to share. They won't be surprised about it or new about it that they're dominant about it.
    * You can do it publicly but risky: "I can notice we are playing white guy ping-pong, can we step back for a moment and make space for other voices (example from a meeting where it happened the most heavy voices were white, including the facilitator)"

## Tools & Equipment

* Pens
* Post-its
* Flip Charts
* Projector
* Miro
* Software
* Playbooks/runbooks

### Playbook

* Playbook/runbook
* Necessary for each event.
* Clear agenda, duration of each section, expectations of facilitation, expectations of the participants, materials needed.
* Example
    * State Purpose
    * State Outcome
    * State all steps, each step has
        * a number for easy reference
        * Time length (start/stop times optionally)
        * Activity description
        * Materials required

### Parking Lot
* Technique for difficult participants
* A placeholder for issues or questions that might need to be dealt with, but at a later point in the session/meeting/workshop.
* You can either address all of the items at a specific time, or else in 1:1's (e.g. during lunch) but make CLEAR when you will address these.
* Even if you know these questions will be answered over the workshop, write it down, let them feel heard and appreciated.
* Goal:
    * Avoid the workshop derailing and explode in discussion.
    * Let people feel heard.
    * It allows them to let go what's in their head, so they can relax more.
* Examples
    * "This is not something we will deal/address now, but I have a section at the end for rapid fire questions and such, what I will do is add this to the parking lot so we can pick it up at the end."
    * "I Understand where you are coming from, I have a lot of things to say about that, if you don't mind trusting the process, I will get back to that (putting that in the parking lot)".

1. raw a simple Kanban board with three columns : Todo, In Progress and Done. This board will help the participants visualize the progress during the discussion.
2. After a quick introduction allow 5 minutes to the participants to individually brainstrom topic ideas. Ask everyone to write a post-it note for each topic they want to discuss.
3. Everyone takes turn and quicky pitch his ideas: What topics they want to discuss and why. Each topic ideas is added to the TODO column on the board. You have an overview of all the topics the individuals want to talk about.
4. Each participant is granted two votes. Voting twice for the same item is permitted. Everyone gather around the board and put a dot on their two favorites topics.
5. Add all votes and priorize/order the topics on the board: the most voted item will be discussed first. If there’s a lot of ideas on the board some items probably did not received any votes: you will not discuss those topics during the session. This is a great way to avoid boring discussion: you only talk about what is interesting to the group.
6. Once you have a prioritized list of the topics you want to discuss, you can move the top item into the In Progress column.
7. Set a timer to 5 minutes and you’re now ready to discuss the topic.
8. Discuss the topic until the time is out !
9. Have a silent roman vote: thumb up if you want to continue the discussion, thumb down if you want to move to the next topic. If you have a majority of thumbs up : reset the timer and continue the discussion. If you have a majority of thumbs down: move the topic to the Done column and move to the next topic !
10. At the end of the session take time to elicit key take-aways: what did we learn ? What actions can we take ?*

## Personal Ideas

* Use the business idea testing experiments to make a list of potential facilitation events.
* How can we use the wisdom of writing clearly, structuring thoughts and the thought process for facilitation events?
    * A small assignment where we ask people to write and think for themselves before joining? Think about how this lady with math, asking students to write first 5 min on how they would go about solving something a math problem that was information incomplete (“how would you try to solve this, if i were to give more information”).
* Quote from [WAC](https://wac.colostate.edu/repository/teaching/intro/include/)
    > [T]alk is important for sharing, clarifying, and distributing knowledge among peers, while asking questions, hypothesizing, explaining, and formulating ideas together are all important mechanisms during peer discussions. Analytical writing is an important tool for transforming rudimentary ideas into knowledge that is more coherent and structured. Furthermore, talk combined with writing appears to enhance the retention of science learning over time. (566)
* Can we use [Blooms Taxonomy](https://tips.uark.edu/using-blooms-taxonomy/) for facilitating ?
* Use the [Coaching Habit](../coaching/index.md) questions as inspiration of what you try to get from an activity (Acitvity Types).
* For some people, you can use a small kan ban as a visual facilitation tool.
