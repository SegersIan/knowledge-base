# Transformer Architecture

The transformer architecture is the current mainstream architecture used for these new foundational models, originally published in the "Attention is all you need" paper.

## Katex test

\[
t=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}|\text{Fix}(g)|
\]

\item For each integer $n\ge2$, the quotient group $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ is a cyclic group generated by $1+n\mathbb{Z}$ and so $\color{red}


Eulerâ€™s identity: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$


```katex
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi
```
$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi
$$
