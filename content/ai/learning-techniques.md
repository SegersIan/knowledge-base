# Learning Techniques

### **1. Supervised learning**

* **Learns from labeled data** (inputs + correct outputs).
* Goal: predict or classify new data.
* *Example:* Predicting house prices from past sales.

### **2. Unsupervised learning**

* **No labels — only raw data.**
* Goal: find patterns or structure.
* *Example:* Grouping customers by shopping behavior (clustering).

### **3. Reinforcement learning**

* **Learns by trial and error.**
* Gets **rewards or penalties** for actions and learns what works best.
* *Example:* Teaching an AI to play chess or drive a car.

### **4. Semi-supervised learning**

* Mix of **a few labeled** and **many unlabeled** examples.
* Useful when labeling data is expensive.
* *Example:* Training a medical image model with some labeled scans and many unlabeled ones.

### **5. Self-supervised learning**

* A type of unsupervised learning where the model **creates its own labels** from data.
* Often used in large language models.
* *Example:* Predicting missing words in a sentence to learn language patterns.

### **6. Transfer learning**

* **Takes knowledge** learned from one task and **applies it to another.**
* *Example:* Using an image model trained on millions of photos to recognize medical scans with limited data.
