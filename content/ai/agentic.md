## Agentic Architecture Patterns

### Single-Agent Pattern

* **Description**: A single AI agent operating independently to achieve a goal. 

### Multi-Agent Pattern

* **Description**: Multiple AI agents working together through communication channels. Trust is usually established between agent identities. 

### Unconstrained Conversational Autonomy

* **Description**: A conversational AI agent that can process and respond to a wide range of inputs without tight constraints. 

### Task-Oriented Agent Pattern

* **Description**: An AI agent designed to perform a specific task, typically by making API calls to other systems. 

### Hierarchical Agent Pattern

* **Description**: A system that has multiple layers of AI agents, with higher-level agents controlling subordinate AI agents. 

### Distributed Agent Ecosystem

* **Description**: A decentralized system of many AI agents working within a shared environment. 

### Human-in-the-Loop Collaboration

* **Description**: A system where AI agents interact with human users in an iterative workflow. 

### Self-Learning and Adaptive Agents

* **Description**: AI agents that can autonomously improve over time based on interactions with their environment.
