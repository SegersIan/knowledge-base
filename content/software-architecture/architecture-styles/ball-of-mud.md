## Description

The Ball Of Mud is rather placeholder for the lack of architecture, resulting in a mess, lack of consistent application of patterns and a bunch of anti patterns. Spaghetti code call it, a ball of hair. Just plain chaos. This is usually the result due to lack of planning, vision and/or governance. **It goes without saying that one never should aim for this architectural style.**

Name originates from [Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder's 1997 paper](http://www.laputan.org/mud/) of the same name.
