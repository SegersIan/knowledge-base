# Design Principles

Describes the **guidelines** for how a system should be constructed. Instead of a hard rule, like the architecture decisions, the guidelines are intended to "guide".

Design (instead of architecture) is more in the "implementation details", in the code base (e.g. [design patterns](https://deviq.com/design-patterns/design-patterns-overview)), or the actual used technology. Architecture is the structure where the design lives in. Note that the line can be grey sometimes.

Example: "Wherever possible, leverage async communication for decoupling"
