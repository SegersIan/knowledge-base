    Introduction to Integration Architecture:

    Definition and importance
    Historical context: From monolithic to modular to microservices and beyond
    Types of Integration:

    Point-to-point vs. hub-and-spoke
    Batch integration
    Real-time integration
    Synchronous vs. asynchronous communication
    Integration Patterns and Styles:

    Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) â€“ e.g., Message Broker, Publish/Subscribe, Dead Letter Channel, etc.
    Integration styles: Database, File transfer, Shared API, Messaging, etc.
    Service-oriented architecture (SOA) and event-driven architecture (EDA)
    APIs & Services:

    REST, SOAP, GraphQL
    API Gateways and Management
    Versioning strategies
    OAuth, JWT, and API security
    Middleware & Brokers:

    Message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka)
    Enterprise service bus (ESB)
    Integration Platforms as a Service (iPaaS)
    Service Mesh:

    Introduction to Service Mesh
    Implementations like Istio, Linkerd, and Consul Connect
    Use cases, benefits, and drawbacks
    Data Integration:

    ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes
    ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) processes
    Data lakes, data warehouses, and data hubs
    Streaming data and real-time analytics
    Integration Security:

    Secure data transmission
    Data masking and tokenization
    Identity and access management in integration contexts
    Monitoring, Logging, and Tracing:

    Importance of observability in integration scenarios
    Tools and practices for monitoring integrated systems
    Distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin)
    Event Sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):

    Concepts and benefits
    Implementation strategies and considerations
    Containerization & Orchestration:
    Docker, Kubernetes, and their role in integration
    Service discovery and scaling in microservices environments
    Integration Testing:
    Contract testing
    End-to-end testing strategies
    Mocking and stubbing external systems
    Architecture Documentation and Standards:
    Documenting integration points, flows, and dependencies
    Establishing and enforcing integration standards and best practices
    Future Trends & Emerging Technologies:
    Serverless architectures and their impact on integration
    Edge computing and integration
    AI/ML in integration scenarios
    Case Studies and Real-world Examples:
    Discussing real-world integration challenges and solutions
    Lessons learned from successful and failed integrations
