# Blog Ideas

Shortlist of ideas on what to write or blog about.

## Key Components of systems and where we find these similarities.
* Systems have componenents/sub systems, and the communication between each of those is relevant. We do this in architecture, in Team topologies we see the same analogy. We identify systems, and teams which are sub systems on their own, and we talk also on the communication channels.
    * System
        * Sub systems/components
        * Relations/communication/Interactions relation
        * ...
    Blog about this!
    
    * Explain core concepts of systems thinking first, then how we see this in all technical fields. 
    * How you can derive characteristics and desired characteristics of a system.
    * Now that we understand the concepts in a system, the relations, how it works, and how to manipulate... how do we now design? How can we consciously guide the design of a system? 
        * Draft current system
        * Draft current characterisstics
        * Draft desired characteristics
        * Draft desired design
        * Design guideliness and principles ? Link these to archetypes that we have in systems thinking.
    * Fields: Architecture, Threat Modelling, Team Topologies, DDD, The Scrum framework, ...
    * How you can also jump over to business about this.
    * How looking at the more generic/abstract "systems Lens" and how this allows to create new "thinking frameworks" and "concepts".
    * Coupling types ? 
        * Behavioral coupling - External dependencies in internal processes
        * Temporal coupling - One entity requires other entities to be performant to fulfill it's own performance requirements
        * Implementation coupling - Having to change multiple entities as a consequence of changing a single entity
