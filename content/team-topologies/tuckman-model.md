# Building Teams

## Tuckman Teal Performance Model

### Stages
There are 4 stages for a team in this model.

#### Forming

Assembling the first time.

#### Storming

Working through the initial differrences in personality and ways of working.

#### Norming

Evolving standard ways of working together.

#### Performing

Reaching a state of high effectiveness.

### Critcism

* **Storming takes continually throughout the life of the team**

* **Overly linear & simplified** – Real teams rarely move cleanly through the four (or five) stages; they often cycle back, skip stages, or progress in parallel.

* **Assumes all teams follow the same path** – Different contexts (remote teams, expert teams, cross-functional teams, high-pressure environments) may develop differently.

* **Focuses on internal dynamics, not external factors** – Organizational culture, leadership structure, incentives, and external constraints often influence team development more than interpersonal stages.

* **Limited empirical evidence** – Despite its popularity, there’s relatively little rigorous research validating the exact stages or sequence.

* **Not ideal for short-term or fluid teams** – Many modern teams form and dissolve rapidly, making the staged model less relevant.

* **Assumes conflict (“storming”) is inevitable** – Some teams may avoid conflict without it harming performance, or may experience constructive conflict at various times.

* **May encourage leaders to “force” stages** – Managers sometimes treat it as a checklist, which can lead to artificial interventions instead of adapting to the team’s real needs.
