## Personal Projects

> Use by default material design from google maybe for simple basic UI. Combined with react if the app is at that maturity level.


* Build your personal website with apps further to create a greate playground.
    * With this you learn to use AI assisted development and tooling.
* YouTube music channel
    * Music Analysis Channel: Take a song per time and create insights and analytics of it and produce a video.
* Guru Channel: Take a GURU podcast/video, transcribe and then analyse the flaws of arguments and good arguments and give a score at the end.
* Fashion Channel: Explain the basics of fashion
* Music Channel: Either just generate music and upload it for tracks or continuous play, OR discuss music/analysis
* sso.segersian.com- apps.segersian.com (only the once your user is allowee to see, and his allows to have other people veta test your solution. Alternatively call it home/user so you have a landing page to see your user, organization and the apps you have access to and all the personal data that we have on your and what’s it used for + a tool to be removed.
* create a tenant/group for just segersian personal user account by default 

## OSINT

* Any cool OSINT projects?

## Cybersecurity

* Start your hack a box journey
* Do a wardriving in you home town.
* Inspect all of your home devices and what data they egress
* Wardrive your garage
* Make a PoC with https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/
* Create your own wireshark, just to learn to low level stuff.
    * But split it into a pcap viewer , where you can visualize the frames in a cool informative way, and the actual capture tool that can stream/output pcap format?
    * As part/separwte or the network capture, the zigbee or whatever protocol for home automation PAN so only listen and replay that.
    * Refine the tool so it helps to measure stuff in the basement network.
    * Also, from network capacture, also a tool for RF capture? So is there a format dor that? Capture the analogue or already digital format for a specific range or protocol, i assume you need a protocol and RF range to know how to read and decode it to digital? …. Research
    * Make a tool that cannlost all tcp and udpnports and services listening on it
* Build this telegram chat bot for phising with voice and audio call, elevnlabs and stuff. What you saw on telegram

## AI

* Find actual  good use cases for Copilot  agents or tech agents and blog about it
   * One agent for Team Topologies / Delivery Setup
   * ...
* Learn about AI usage
* Learn about Agentic AI Usage
* Experiment with MCP and the returned data formats
* Try spec driven development
* Make a PoC with https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/mcp-scan
* Make a Poc for Agents with https://google.github.io/adk-docs/
* mcp-studio.segersian.com (mcp tools connecting to my various downstream tools, integrations, moght be a business idea)
* ai.segersian.com , what could I do here?
* Explore https://code.claude.com/docs/en/vs-code
* Explore https://claude.com/download?
* Explore https://clawd.bot/


## Product Ideas


* dev-graph.segersian.com (graph of entire dev environment)
* An EU alternative to GitHub, that's decoupled from US.
    * See your chatgpt for alternative, experiment, try and see if building a new alternative makes sense.
    * A agent or tool in GitHub that can scan for finding max use cases in github native env as part of devops flow. Just easy poc with somenpromp engineering!
    * Add AI in it's core flow, check European models for that.
    * Rmemeber, your repo workbench toolkit would be a cool addition/feature to it.
    * Ai and mcp at it's core!
    * Think like the ai repo/gir, happy face or whatever for Europe
    * Are there really no cool privacy or security ideas, together with eu gdpr models that you can find cool use cases ? Dev tools are cool, but will nee a free tier GTM strategy, finding something that can be white label, can go through partner reselling
    * gitverse
    * Must be geeky and badass
    * Maybe there are some oss versions as temporary first approach and then build your own business
