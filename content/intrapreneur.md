# Intrapreneur

Today, Chaitali covers seven habits of “intrapreneurs”:

1. Run towards problems, not away from them
2. Take end-to-end ownership to land the solution
3. Invest in cross-functional relationships
4. Get sponsorships
5. Don’t fear “no”
6. Make impact visible
7. Do everything, everywhere, all at once
