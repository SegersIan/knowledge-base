### Being an “Intrapreneur” as a Software Engineer

*By Gergely Orosz & Chaitali Narla* ([newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com][1])

**Core idea**:
Cultivate an entrepreneurial mindset *within* a company — you don’t have to leave to act like an entrepreneur. Being an “intrapreneur” helps you deliver more impact, grow your career, and build skills useful even if you later join or found a startup.

### Why It Matters Now

* The tech job market is tougher; layoffs, stricter reviews, and fewer openings make internal leverage more valuable. ([newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com][1])
* Developing intrapreneurial habits positions you not only for success *where you are*, but also if you later strike out on your own. ([newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com][1])

### The 7 Habits of Intrapreneurs

1. **Run towards problems, not away from them**
   Don’t wait for perfect conditions — seek out unresolved issues and step up.

2. **Take end-to-end ownership to land the solution**
   From conception through execution and adoption, see it through.

3. **Invest in cross-functional relationships**
   Build trust and influence across teams (product, design, marketing, ops).

4. **Get sponsorships**
   Find senior advocates who believe in your work and help you navigate internal politics.

5. **Don’t fear “no”**
   Rejections are part of the process — learn from them, iterate, and persist.

6. **Make impact visible**
   Measure, document, and share results so your work is recognized and valued.

7. **Do everything, everywhere, all at once**
   Be proactive across domains — you’re not only writing code, but influencing strategy, processes, and culture.

> These are not sequential steps but overlapping practices. ([newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com][1])

### Tips for Bringing These Habits into Your Work

* Start small: pilot initiatives in your area of influence before scaling them.
* Be explicit: define metrics of success, timelines, and responsibilities.
* Communicate broadly: share your plans, progress, and results with stakeholders.
* Learn from feedback and failure: use “no”s and setbacks to iterate.
* Don’t wait for permission: if something makes sense and can be done, begin with what you have.

### Benefits & Trade-Offs
