# Network Security

## Designing Secure Networks
* Different security controls usually operate on a distinct [ISO Model Layer](<../../computer-networks#the-7-layers>)
  * Most popular: Application Layer (7); Transport Layer (4) ; and Network Layer (3)

### Infrastructure Considerations
* **Attack Surface** - Points at which an unauthorized user could gain access.
* **Device Placement** - Physical placement are impact by needs, features and prefered topology and security design
  * Examplex: create VLANs, ...
* **Security Zones** - Network segments (physical/virtual)
  * For many reasons
  * Exampoles: Guest networks, internet facing networks (DMZ), management networks, higher clearance level, more sensitive data.
* **Connectivity Considerations** how connectivity is implemented (wifi, optics, cable, ...) and necessary throughput
  * Also multiple ISPs/failover connections are part of this
* **Failure Modes** - What if a security device fails ? Depends on business requirements
  * `fail-closed` - block any traffic during failure
  * `fail-open` - do't interfere with traffic during failure
* **Network Taps** to monitor traffic
  * `active` powered
  * `passive` not powered (removes los off power failure mode)

### Network Design Concepts
* **Physical Isolation**
  * aka **Air-Gapped**`
* **Logical Segmentation**
* **High Availability**
* **Implementing Secure Protocols**
* **Reputation Services**
* **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)**
* **SD-WAN**
* **Scure Access Service Edge (SASE)**
