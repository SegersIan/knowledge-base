# Wireless and Mobile Security
> Have distinct challenges compared to wired networks.
> They broadcast their signals and are often available from outside the area that an organization contols.

## Building Secure Wireless Networks

### Connection Methods

#### Cellular
* networks provide connectivity by dividing geographic areas into "cells".
* Each cell might have more than one tower.
* 5G needs more attena density, but has more throughput, so requires more antenna planning than 4G.
* Provided by cellular carriers. - So it's a external network from your organization.
* *Operating Scope* : Long range

#### WIFI
* is a set of protocols for wireless LAN.
* Most popular *radio bands*: `2.4 GHz` and `5.0 GHz`
* Uses *multiple channels* for different WIFI networks to coexist in each others vicinity.
* *Key security concern* is that the signals travel outside the organization's walls.
* *Different standards* `802.11b`, `802.11ac`, `802.11x`, `802.11n`, `802.11g`...
  * Some are "aliased" like WIFI 6 is the alias for `802.11ax`
* *Protocols* like `WPA2` and `WPA3` provide security like encryption, authentication and network frames protection.
* *Wifi Devices Modes*
  * `ad hoc` - device-2-device communication, like p2p. No intermediaries. But both devices must be able to reach each other. Sometimes called mesh.
  * `infrastructure` - direct all traffic through base station/access point. Typical for your home router or access point. They follow a star/hub-and-spoke network design.
* `Service Set Identifiers (SSID)` are used to identify networks, these can be broadcasted or kept private.
* *Operating Scope* : Mid range

| 802.11a | | 54 Mbit/s | 5 GHz |
| 802.11g | | 54 Mbit/s | 2.4 GHz |
| 802.11n | Wi-Fi 4 | 600 Mbit/s | 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz |
