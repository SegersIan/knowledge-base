# Social Engineering

* Human side of cybersecurity
### Social Engineering
* And phising often preceed password attacks.
* Using the "Human Threat vector"
* Goal: Influence target(s) to take actions that they else would not
* Key Principiples to sucess:
  * *Authority* - Give the impression that you have authority, most people obey to someone that seems in charge or knowledgable, regardless if they are or not.
  * *Intimidation* - Scare or threaten the target so they feel threatened and they take the action that the attacker wants them to do.
  * *Consensus* - (aka Social Proof) people tend to do what other (many people already did), "everyone in here did this except for you"
  * *Scarcity* - Make something look more desirable to the target
  * *Familiarity* - Making the target like the attacker or the organization that the attacker claims to represent
  * *Trust* - Similar to familiarity, here the attacker builds a connection with their target to them make them do things.
  * *Urgence* - Sense or urgency to take the chance away for the target to evaluate the situation
* Often a combination of principles are used.
* Understand the target, how humans react, how stress reactions can be leveraged to meet a goal.
### Social Engineering Techniques
* *Phising* - Fraudelent acquisition of information
  * Spear phising - targetting a specific individual/group
  * Whaling - aimed at senior people (CEO, CTO, ...)
  * Defenses: Awareness training
* *Vishing* - Phising via phone call
  * Often based on urgency/trust and authority
* *Smishing* - Phising via SMS/IM
  * Often based on urgency/trust and authority
  * Often trick someone to click on a link to enter credentials or senstive information
* *Misinformation & Disinformation* - Online influencer campaigns
  * Social media, email, online mediums
  * Types (MDM)
    *** Misinformation - Not True, *without* malicious intent
      * I believe it's true, but its wrong
    *** Disinformation - Not True, *with* malicious intent
    *** Malinformation - based on reaility, but consciously removed context and using exaggeration *with* malicious intent
  * CISA recommends "TRUST" oricess to counter mis/disinformation
    *** Tell your story
    *** Ready your team
    *** Understand and assess MDM.
    *** Strategize response.
    *** Track outocomes.
    * Defense: asses info environment, identify vulnerabilities, proactive communication, develop incident response plan.
* *Impersonation* - Attack pretends to be someone else
  * Might use identity graud
* *Business Email Compromises (BEV)* -
  * AKA Email Account Compromise (EAC)
  * Defeneses: Awareness and MFA
  * Methods
    * Using compromised accounts
    * Sending spoofed emails
    * Using common fake but similar domain techniques
    * Using malware or other tools
* *Pretexting* - Using a made uo scenario on why the attacker approaches the target
  * Often to make impersonation more believable
  * Defeneses: Be critical, and do a verification call
* *Watering Hole Attacks* - Use websites that the target frequently uses
  * Attackers can set an attack, knowing the target will visit the site. By compromising the site or deploying malway through advertising networks
* *Brand Impersonation/spoofing* - Also a phising attack
  * Send email as if it comes from the brand
  * Often intended to have the target log in to a link
* *Typosquatting* - Have a copy/compromised site with a common typo im url
  * *Pharming* - Changing the host file of a person to do similar attack
