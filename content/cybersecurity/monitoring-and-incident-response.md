# Monitoring and Incident Response

## Incident Response (IR)

### The Incident Response Process/Cycle

> The process is not linear, you might go back and forth based on findings and learnings.

* 1. **Preparation** - build tools, processes, and procedures to respond to an incident.
  * Includes: Build team, train, conduct exercises, document, configure tools.
* 2. **Detection** Reviewing events to identify incidents
  * [IoCs](<malware-types#indicators-of-compromise-iocs>), loge analysis and security monitoring + awareness and reporting program for staf.
* 3. **Analysis** - An event is indentified, identify other related events and their targer/impact.
* 4. **Containment**  - Contain the incident from furher escalation
  * Not always clear what to do, quarantine (move a system to an isolated network) is an method,
* 5. **Eradication** - Remove the artificats related to the incident
  * Restore systems, rebuild systems, restore backups, and verify its clean
* 6. **Recovery** - Restore back to normal
  * Move a system out of quarantine, go back online, fixes to remediate the chance of immediatly reoccring
  * Make sure to update a backlog for improvememts based on past incidents.
* 7. \[Optional\] **Post Mortem** - Lessons learned, reflect.
* **Back to 1** - so repeat, as you can now prepare again better

#### Prepering for Incident Response

* Building the **Incident Response Team**
  * Includes a member of management/organizational leadership.
