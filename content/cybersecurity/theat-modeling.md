# Threat Modeling - Agentic AI

## MAESTRO

CEO and Chief AI officer Ken Huan at DistributedApps.ai came up with the **MAESTRO** threat modeling framework for agentic AI. The MAESTRO is an abbreviation for **M**ulti-**A**gent **E**nvironment, **S**ecurity, **T**hreat, **R**isk, and **O**utcome.

### Principles
* **Extended Security Categories**: We're expanding traditional categories like STRIDE, PASTA, and LINDDUN with AI-specific considerations. For example:
* **Multi-Agent and Environment Focus**: Explicitly considering the interactions between agents and their environment. A self-driving car must be aware of other cars, objects, and weather conditions.
* **Layered Security**: Security isn't a single layer, but a property that must be built into each layer of the agentic architecture.
* **AI-Specific Threats**: Addressing threats arising from AI, especially adversarial ML and autonomy-related risks.
* **Risk-Based Approach**: Prioritizing threats based on likelihood and impact within the agent's context.
* **Continuous Monitoring and Adaptation**: Ongoing monitoring, threat intelligence, and model updates to address the evolving nature of AI and threats.
