# Endpoint Security

## Operating System Vulnerability Types

* **Vulnerabilities in the OS itself**
* **Default passwords & Insecure (Default) Settings**
* **Insecure configurations**
* **Misconfiguration**

## Hardware Vulnerability Types
Note: Often hard to deal directly with, so compensating controls are key.

* **Firmware** - embedded software of devices
  * Not always possible to update
  * Requires sometimes *manual* updates, and not part of automated updates.
  * Attacks: Via any way that allows access to the firmware itself
    * Examples: executable updates, user download malicious firmware and network enabled updates that provide remote-acces to firmware and management.
    * Reintalling the OS wouldn't change a thing
  * Defenses
    * Firmware validation!
* **End-Of-Life or Legacy hardware** - means no moe support or patches from cendor
  * Tips/watch for
    * End-Of-Sales: Last day the device will be sold (might be still in supply chain via resellers for a grace period)
    * End-Of-Life: Not sold anymore, but still supported, should get rid of it though.
    * End-Of-Support: Last day that vendor will provide support/updates/patches.
    * Legacy: Unsupported.
