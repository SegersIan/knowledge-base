## Overlap Summary

* **EDR ‚Üî XDR ‚Üî NDR:** all detect and respond, but at different layers (endpoint vs. network vs. multi-source).
* **Firewall ‚Üî IPS:** both inspect traffic, but IPS is more about deep packet analysis.
* **CASB ‚Üî DLP:** both protect data, CASB focuses on *where*, DLP on *what*.
* **SIEM ‚Üî SOAR ‚Üî XDR:** all about detection and response, but differ in automation and scope.
* **ZTNA ‚Üî VPN ‚Üî Firewall:** all control access, but ZTNA is identity- and context-based (modern evolution).
