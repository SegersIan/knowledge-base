# About

My personal knowledge base where I keep summaries and note of useful professional knowledge.
All the content is publicly available on [GitHub](https://segersian.github.io/knowledge-base/) and [my public site](https://kb.segersian.com)

Consider this entirely "Work In Progress", there will be many incomplete parts, nor will it ever be complete. These notes help me structured my thoughts, reference back to them at a later point, or share them with others informally.
