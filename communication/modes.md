# Communication Modes

Much of this is inspired from [Florian](https://xahteiwi.eu/) and findings regarding on how [remote work](https://xahteiwi.eu/devopsdaystlv-2019/#/) can work.

## Remote Work

If you want to make remote work, work, you must learn how remote work can work. It won't succeed when sticking to  old habits that are not compliant with remote work. For remote work to succeed, you must adopt and new skills to make it work.

> Working in a distributed team means working asynchronously.
> Being productive in a distributed team is a skill that most people must learn; it is not innate to us.
> Nothing has as dire an impact on productivity as poor communications.
> A capable distributed team habitually externalizes information.

Information is generally far less useful when it is only stored in one person’s head, as opposed to being accessible in a shared system that everyone trusts and can use. If you take important information out of your own head and store it in a medium that allows others to easily find and contextualize it, that’s a win for everyone.

## Types

### Chat/IM

* Often the norm (especially in remote/distributed work).
* Excessively using chat isn’t being efficient. It’s being lazy.
* It's easy: Fire and forget 
* Difficult to find information after the fact.
* Even harder to grasp the whole context around the information you search for.

### Email

* Easier to share with a person or group.
* Harder to loop people into an ongoing discussion after the fact.
* Still hard to find information, although you marginally better than chat, because of its threading.

### Wiki

* Very easy to share, find and contextualize information.
