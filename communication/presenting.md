# Presenting Ideas & Talks (TED)

* Many of the general tips, process and structure of Explanatory writing are applicable.
* As with many things, test your talks
* Talk styles to avoid:
   * The sales pitch
   * Ramble/Complain/Rant and being under prepared
   * The org bore: No one cares about your org unless you work there
   * Inspiration Performance: Only present because of ego and to "inspire", inspiration is a byproduct of a great presentation.
* Talk Tools
   * Connection
      * Make eye contact
      * Show vulnerability
      * Make em laugh - but not squirm
      * Park your ego
      * Tell a story
      * Avoid politics
   * Narration
      * Use story telling instead of just summarizing facts, we do this as a species for thousands of years, you love it. It helps you connect.
      * Tips
         * Built it on a character your audience can empathize with.
         * Built tension through curiosity, social intrigue or actual danger.
         * Offer right level of detail. Too little and it's not vivid, too much and it gets bogged down.
         * End with satisfying resolution, being funny, moving or revealing.
         * Execution matters
         * It has to be true
         * Don't overshare, if you share intimately, have worked through it
         * Parables are nice
   * Explanation 
      * Example of a good explanation
         * Step 1: Start right where you are, ground it... Make it relevant to us,...
         * Step 2: Create curiosity 
         * Step 3: Introduce concepts on by one
         * Step 4: Use metaphors
         * Step 5: Use examples
      * Explanations should be linear, built up, and if possible, use a structure that invites the receiver to become curious. 
      * Be weary of "curse of knowledge", make sure you don't over or under assume what the audience knows. Don't want to offend their intelligence, but neither intimidate them with expecting they know everything you talk about.
      * Consider making clear what your idea "isn't" which can manage expectations and clarify already things. (e.g. mindful eating does not require you to learn meditation.)
      * If you explain well, you can generate also **excitement** about your idea.
   * Persuasion
      * Short
         * Persuasion is the act of replacing someone's worldview with something better.
         * And at its hears is the power of reason, capable of long-term impact.
         * Reason is best accompanied by intuiting pumps, detective stories, or other plausibility-priming devices.
      * Means convincing the audience that they way they currently see the world isn't quite right.
         * First: Take down the parts that aren't working well
         * Second: Rebuild something better
         * Last: An upbeat statement or some conclusion of sorts?
         * Example: People on a social media diet assumes the world is full of constant violence. This is wrong, shows data on that violence only has been decreasing. Then remind how cruel history was and some of the ages. Then, show how modern media has incentive to lead with stories of drama, regardless if they're representative or not. Showing how we might overestimate the levels of violence. And create perceptive, the total number is not relevant, but the CHANCE you experience violence. And then ending with "Don't just ask what we do wrong? But also, what are we doing right?"
            * Based on "[The better angels of our nature](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13543093-the-better-angels-of-our-nature)" by Steven Pinker and his TED talk.
      * Priming is important. Don't start with the end conclusion, which can sound so unlikley and a far reach. Follow the above steps and prime the audience. On step at a time, go through the journey and prime the idea.
      * Use [Intuition Pumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuition_pump)
         * Example through story the audience's intuition can "tell" where the story is going to (remember the TED talk about too much choice makes you unhappier, as he tels about the experience of buying a jeans)
         * Often instead of using (only) reasoned arguments, intuition pumps are more powerful, that's very common in philosophy. We nudge the audience in our direction.
         * Reasoned arguments in itself are also good tools
      * Reasoned Arguments
         * IF/THEN: If X is true, then clearly Y follows (Because X implies a Y)
            * Break down into small steps, thought steps, and then apply the IF/THEN approach to build buy in and agreement from the audience along the journey, with each small step.
               * See TED Talk [Dan Pallota](https://youtu.be/bfAzi6D5FpM?si=ZzSjRouYmUCh7u1y)
         * Reductio ad absurdum](https://iep.utm.edu/reductio/):
            *  a mode of argumentation that seeks to establish a contention by deriving an absurdity from its denial
            * Take the "counter position" to what you're arguing and showing that it leads to contradiction. If that counter position is "false" it strengthens your position.
            * Example on how we frown on high salaries for nonprofit leaders: "You want to make 50M selling violent video games to kids, got for it, we'll put you on *Wired*, but you want to make 0.5M trying to cure kids of malaria, you're considered a parasite yourself"
               * See TED Talk [Dan Pallota](https://youtu.be/bfAzi6D5FpM?si=ZzSjRouYmUCh7u1y)
            * Effective, but handle with care, use it on issues, not people or opponents. 
      * Detective Story: 
         * Structure: 
            * The big mystery
            * Travel the world for ideas in search of possible solutions
            * Rule then out one by one
            * Until one viable solution survives
      * More than logic: Logic is a big part, but make it more human, there are some tools:
         * Inject some humor early one
         * Add an anecdote
         * Offer vivid examples
         * Recruit 3th party validation
         * Use powerful visuals

   * Revelation
      * ... todo

## General Tips
* Throughline: same as a lead? At least the tips of a good throughline should be listed as good tips.
* Prune tip “plan your talk, cut 50%, once you’ve grieved the loss of half your talk, cut it another 50 percent” 
* Old formula used by sir ken robinson **“a good essay answers 3 questions: what? So what? Now what?”**.
* An idea based talk starts with curiosity, a issue based talk starts with morality, and that can cause morality fatigue
* Most speakers are used to talking for 30 or 40 minutes or longer. They find it literally hard to imagine giving a proper talk in such a short period of time. Hear we see the recurring team and need to write and think clear. Pruning clutter.


## Example of engaging writing

... instead of listing boring facts about yourself

> I want you to come with me to student's room at Oxford university in 1977. You open the door, and at first it seems like there's nobody there.
> But wait, Over in the corner, there's a boy lying on the floor, face up, staring at the ceiling. He's been like that for more than 90 minutes. That's me, 27 year old me. I'm thinking. Hard. I am trying... please don't laugh... I am trying to solve the problem of free will. That deep mystery that has stumped the world's philosophers for at least 2 millennia? Yp, I'm taking it on.
> Anyone looking objectively at the scene would have concluded that this biy was some weird combination of arrogant, deluded, or perhaps just socially awkward and lonely, proffering the company of ideas to people.
> But my own narrative? I'm a dreamer. I've always been obsessed by the power of ideas. And I'm pretty sure it's that inward focus that helped me survive growing up in a boarding schools in India and England, away from my missionary parents, and that gave me confidence to try build a media company. Certainly it was the dreamer in me that fell in love so deeply with TED.
