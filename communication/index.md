## Writing Well And Writing To Learn

These notes come from 2 different books by the same author, but the content feel so intertwined, it feels like one book.

### General Tips

This are all soft rules.

* Know you audience.
* Simplicity: prune any excess words and use simple words.
   * Clutter is the disease of american writing
   * Clutter hides often painful truth
   * Clutter can be intentional vagueness
   * Political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible
* The best "jargon" literature is even accessible to people from outside the field.
* Beware of the long word thats no better than the short word
* Be cautious of meta text «its interesting to note..», just note it.
* Don't inflate ("with the possible exception…" just say "exception")
* Don’t repeat recently mention information.
* Don't use adjectives that are implied (tall skyscraper)
* The more vague your ideas, the less confident or selling you sound.
* Write in first person, its more intimate, if your writing is good, your writing is worthy, people will care about your say. Don’t be shy or think you are egocentric. 
   * Some areas don’t allow this, like writing newspapers.
* Unity to the same pronoun (talking 1st, 2nd or 3th person) across your text. (formal, informal)
* Unity in tense (past, current, ...)
* Unity in mood/tone
   * E.g. Start of conversational, then switch to sound as a travel guide.
* Have more research material or detail than necessary, so you can pick what works well for you.
* Narrative is oldest and most compelling method of holding someones attention, everybody wants to be told a story. Always look fo says to convey information in narrative form.
* To conceal meaning is equally to conceal the lack of meaning 
* Sentences should have people in them

### The Process

* Iterative:
   * Write what you want to say
   * Then prune what does not add value or clutters.
   * Use a [thesaurus](https://www.thesaurus.com/) to find better wording.
   * Simplify where possible, rewrite.
   * Reread
   * Repeat
* Once you have the core of what you want to say, you can gently add some fluff to your liking.
* Warming up: It’s common to throw away first paragraphs once you found your style.
* This iterative process causes you to structure and clarify your thoughts, resulting into better understanding.
* Short: What do I want to say? Write ? Did I say what I wanted ? Review, Iterate.

#### Tips

* As you write, you might discover other unities you want to adapt, thats fine and natural, whatever vibes well. Just update the whole piece to conform.
* Am i saying what i want to say?

### The Structure

#### The Lead

* Show what's in it for the reader, so they know why to keep reading. Get them hooked, nudge curiosity.
   * Freshness, novelty, humor, surprise, unusual idea, paradox, interesting fact, question
* Continue to build. Every paragraph should amplify the preceding one. Give more thought to adding solid detail and less to entertaining the reader.
* Last sentence of paragraph must be springboard to next one. Give that sentence extra humor or surprise, so you have them for another paragraph. That sentence can also restore to an easy going tone, after some colder facts or details.

#### The Ending

* Give almost as much thought to your last sentence, as your first.
* When you announce the beginning of a summary of things covered in the article, people loose focus
* Be weary of the sandwich technique
* The last paragraph must linger, take by surprise, a joy in itself
* When you are ready to stop, stop
* Once presented all facts, made your point, go for nearest exit

### Clutter and Verbosity Examples
* currently : now
* At the presence: now
* Even «now» can be often dropped «its raining», the tense says enough!
* Experiencing pain : Hurting
* Assistance : help
* Referred to as: called
* I might add: just add it, don’t go so meta (it’s interesting to note, just note)
* Smile happy: smile

### Insights

* Writing code is the same mental process.
   * You make something work (e.g. Make a test pass)
   * You refactor towards cleaner code.
   * You run the tests again to make sure they pass.
   * You iterate
   * As you iterate, you get more clarity how it all fits together, you structure, you process.
* Programmers are non-fiction writes.
* Rubber Ducking: As you try to explain a problem, you need to clarify your thoughts about the problem, so you can express them clearly. Often, you will find the answer yourself through this process of clarifying your thoughts.
* Any thought process works better by writing.
   * Write your journey through the process, clarifying your thoughts.
   * You can reread your thoughts and improve them.
   * If you focus on clarification and simplification, you will get a better understanding.
   * Examples: RFC, Research, Design Document, Diary, Journal, Architecture Proposal, Presentation, Blogging
   * Writing an email in particular benefits from this: Any additional back-n-forth communication that is required due to unclarity, is exhausting.
   * People that blog often, do write clear ones, often have a good understanding of things, through the process of writing a good blog post.
* Those who do not try effort in improving and simplifying their writing, yet write a lot, will not grow.
* The more you embrace the process of writing well, the more clear your thoughts become.

### Writing Across The Curriculum

By giving a math problem in a context and have students write about it, they will naturally think more across the curriculum. Think of the world population growth issue, the question was all about how would you calculate or understand exponential growth. The writes would also think, do we have room? What is the impact? What are the solutions? So aside of thinking about the math, they also thought about all the other related and relevant parts in other fields (sociology, economics, ethics, sustainability, …)

## The Iterative Thought Process (to achieve clear thinking?)
A self defined process, based on the insights of writing well and writing to learn.

* The **"The Iterative Thought Process"** is a more generic version of this. You guide your brain, you structure your thoughts through different mediums (writing, drawing, visualizing, ...). Writing happens to be one of them that works quite well.
   * Visual Methods: Miro board, mind map, Business Model Canvas, Value Proposition Canvas, KanBan Board, ...
   * Key is to have a way to "Annotate" or "Visualize" concepts and thoughts and their relations (just like a system) so you can offload it all. Then you can review it, restructure, simplify, prune, do all the usual iterative steps to improve your thoughts and understanding.
   * Steps:
      * Offload your thoughts
      * Structure (relations between them)
      * Prune
      * Review
      * Iterate
   * By offloading, it allows us to reflect on it, and work on it, however, most just offload and keep at that. 
   * By offloading, you create room for other thoughts and reflection, play with all elements.
   * By offloading, you can focus on subparts of the whole topic.
   * Did you know that your brain uses a constant amount of energy? Thinking harder, doesn't result in using more energy. That's why, when you focus, other things go to the background. Taking that fact in account, knowing the energy supply is constant, you can offload your thoughts, so the spotlight can then focus on the individual elements and parts, without keeping the big picture in your head.
* When writing as a part of the thought process: Write in a way that they don’t worry about beings criticized, it would damage/block their train of thoughts and ideas. That’s why a journal works so well.

### Related Concepts 

According to ChatGPT.

1. **Cognitive Load Theory**: This theory, developed by John Sweller, explores how human cognitive architecture handles information processing. It posits that learning is more effective when information is presented in a way that reduces unnecessary cognitive load, which aligns with the idea of refining and simplifying thoughts to enhance understanding and communication.

2. **Iterative Design**: In design fields, the iterative process involves repeated cycles of prototyping, testing, and refining a product or concept. This approach helps in gradually improving clarity and functionality, akin to refining thoughts or visualizations.

3. **Metacognition**: This is the awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes. Metacognition involves self-regulation of cognition through planning, monitoring, and evaluating, which can include refining and rephrasing thoughts for better clarity.

4. **Visual Thinking**: This is a way to organize your thoughts and improve your ability to think and communicate through visual means. Techniques such as mind mapping, sketching, and diagramming are used to clarify and simplify complex ideas.

5. **Information Design**: This field focuses on presenting information in a way that is most effective for understanding. It includes principles of clarity, simplicity, and the reduction of unnecessary complexity, often achieved through visual means.

6. **Clarity in Communication**: The process of rewriting or rephrasing thoughts to enhance clarity is a fundamental principle in communication studies. Techniques from this field are often employed to ensure messages are clear, concise, and effective.
