## Writing Well And Writing To Learn

These notes come from 2 different books by the same author, but the content feel so intertwined, it feels like one book.

### Simplicity

* "Clutter is the disease of american writing." Scratch any excess words and use simple words.

### Clutter

* «Clutter is political correctness gone amok.»
* Clutter hides often painful truth.
* «Political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible» aka clutter is used
* Cuter can be intentional vagueness.
* «Beware of the long word thats no beyer than the short word»
* Be cautious of meta text «its interesting to note..», just note it.
* Don't inflate (with the possible exception… just use «exception»)
* Don’t repeat recently mention information.
* Don't use adjectives that are implied (tall skyscraper)
* Reread often, but bracket around potential clutter, if its pompous or pretention , its for sure clutter. Simplify, reread, remove, simplify,…
* The more vague your ideas, the less confident or selling


### Style

- Size doesnt matter. When you shorten stuff, you won’t loose your style. When you simplify, you validate if the core structure is there. Once that is read, you can fluff it up a bit to your style. 
- It is common that it takes a while to warm up also your writing style. It’s common for authors to throw away first paragraphs or pages as it took a while to get into their style.
- Try to write in first person, its more intimate, if your writing is good, you writing is worthy, people will care about your say. Don’t be shy or think you are egocentric. Some areas don’t allow this obviously, like writing  newspapers.

### The Audience

- have unity in pronoun (talking 1st, 2nd or 3th person) across your text, formal, informal,…
- Have unity in tense (past, current,…?)
- Have unity in mood/tone. Any is good, just dont mix (dont go : let me take you on my trip, then sound as a travel broxhure, then sound as guidebook). Judgemental? Detached ? Amused? Conversational?
- How much do i want to cover
- What one point do i want to make, a good piece has one povocative thought to leave to the reader, and only one
- As you write, you might discover other unities you want to adapt, thats fine and natural, whatever vibes wel. Just update the whole article to conform.

### The Lead And The Ending

- the begining must show what’s in it for the reader, so they know why to keep reading. Get them hooked. Anything will do as long it nudges curiosity and tugd at his sleeve. (Frehness, novelty, humor, surprise, unusual idea, paradox, interesting fact, wuestion)
- Continue to build. Everey paragraph should amplify the preceding one. Give more thought to adding solid detail and less to entertaining the reader.
- Last sentence of paragraph must be springboard to next one. Give that sentence extra humor or surprise, so you have em for another paragraph. That sentence can also restore to an easy going tone, after some colder facts or details.
- Have more resesrch material or detail than necessary, so you can pick what works well for yo
- Narrative is oldest and most compelling method of holding someones attention, everybody wants to be told a story. Always look fo says to convey information in narrative form.
- Give almost as much thought to your last sentence, as your first.
- When you announce the beginning of a summary of things covered in the article, people loose focus
- Be weary of the sandwich technique
- The last paragraph must linger, take by surprise, a joy in itself
- When you are ready to stop, stop
- Once presented all facts, made your point, go for nearest exit

### Examples
- currently : now
- At the presence: now
- Even «now» can be often dropped «its raining»
- Are you experiencing pain? Does it hury?
- Assistance : help
- Reffered to as: called
- «I might add»: just add it, don’t go so meta (it’s interestinh to note, just note)
- Smile happy: smile

## Raw Notes



- to conceal meaning is equally to conceal the lack of meaning 
- Sentences should have people in them




Use the business idea testing experiments to make a list of potential facilitations events.


- programming is same, when writing, is a process, not a product
You write to learn, as you do with programming, thats how you understand, refine, refase, structure thoughts, good code is like clear text and clear thinking, its all the same similar thought and brain process

Programmets are non fiction writers, non fiction literature, you describe a problem, you can get all fuzzy and verbose, or clear thinking and concise, refactor, just as you rewrite.

A good writer writes first version, rewrites, structering thoughts as you go, getting more clear , especially in non fiction. So, thats so compareble to the programming process.

Maybe make a blog post.

Note also how clear writing , the proces of it, helps as you design solutions, gather requirements, rubber ducking, all våcause you try to collect and structure thoughts.

Next time , before you sent out an email, reread it, how structured is it, did you rewrite or tried to make ir more concise ormclear? Or a chat message? With all this async communication, every extra back n forth counts, energy wasted on misunderstanding by others, or the, trying to get your message.

Rewrite, rephrase, pruning, shaping, maturing your thoughts or the message

Thats why blogging is an onteresting phenomenon. Just blogging helps people to structuree and mature ideas, cause they might rewrite, write, prune, improve thpughts. Note not every blog is clearly written, but its also a part of a process. Thats why sritten a blog with not many readers can still be useful and satisfying. Bloggers , especially in regards with job and suvch, mature their ideas, get better and clearer, same with technicsl presentations, and then book writers, talks, et … the process they inadverently adapt, allowa for their ideas to improve and become clearer, making them beteer communicators or also able to think deeper and produce. Omplex stuff (validate if true with research)

«The clear thinker»


Writing how you got somewhere, your reasoning and such, yields also in beter results of your output. That’s what also a good ADR or SAD document looks like!

Am i saying what i want to say?

“Let me take care of that”, how small even the problem. You get noticee for taking care of things, tha attidue, and getting things done.

Because of the writing process to write clear, we came up inadvertently with things that help think clear. To think clear, tou can write, or use tools like BMC, VP canvas, other models, see the little books about ways to make decisions. These are all tools tha thelp to think more clearly and have a clear mind and understanding.

Writing to learn is a good example on how to lesrn and reason, instead of the focus on the right answer, it allows for experimentstiom and reflection. 

Writinf is a process, so documenting your thought process forces you to think and be more involved:
- a diary
- a journal
- your notes

Document your thoughts and the process, it helps you structure and get better. It helps also to offload  your thoughts, it allowa you to make room.

When you are working on a big problem, you need to chunk it down, like the little acorn of whitw stripes, one step at a timw.

Offload, mindmap, structure, play, move around, miro.

What helps ist yo suggest people to write in a way that they don’t worry about beings criticized, it would damage/block their train of thoughts and ideas. That’s why a journal works so well.

Offloading your thoughts on paper, allows you to take a step back, and re-itterate. See the bigger picture, and then zoom back in. Use writing but also visuals if it helps.

Ask yourself, what can we learn about this for facilitating? A small assignment where we ask people to write and think for themselves before joining? Think about how this lady with math, asking students to write first 5 min on how they would go about solving something a math problem that was information incomplete (“how would you try to solve this, if i were to give more information”).

There must be some cool lessons and insights towards this.

Write across the curriculum: search anout it

Maybe for coaching, a good advice would be to let people write themselves through the process, as it helps to clear through the journey and process.


By giving a math problem in a context and have students write about it, they will naturally think more across the curriculum. Think of the world population growth issue, the question was all about how would you calculate or understand exponential growth. The writes would also think, do we have room? What is the impact? Ehat are the solutions? So aside of thinking about the math, they also thought about all the other related and relevant parts in other fields (sociology, economics, ethics, sustainability, …)

- throughline: same as a lead? At least the tips of a good throughline should be listed as good tips. But is it the same? Same as for an email? Same as…

- “great writing is all about the power of the deleted word” - richard bach, author

- prune tip “plan your talk, cut 50%, once you’ve grieved the loss of half your talk, cut it another 50 percent” 

“Leave space and say less”

- page 38 has a beautiful rewrite on how to write more engaging, introduce yourself, without going’s through a long boring list off facts.

- old formula wuited by sir ken robinson “a good essay answers 3 questions: what? So what? Now what?”, it’s not the only answer, but interesting, cause i found myself sometimes applying same sequence and structure in presentations.


- an idea based talk starts with curiosity, a issue based talk starts with morality, and that can cause morality fatigue

“If i had more time, i would have written a shorter letter”

Quote famous

We can see this recurring also in good public speaking. Which is often non fiction

Certainly! Here are a few common cognitive biases that can hinder clear thinking, reasoning, and effective communication:

1. **Confirmation Bias**  
   - This is the tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses. This bias can lead to poor decision-making because it causes individuals to overlook or dismiss information that contradicts their views.

2. **Anchoring Bias**  
   - This occurs when individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information they receive (the "anchor") when making decisions. Subsequent judgments are often made by adjusting away from that anchor, which can lead to systematic errors.

3. **Availability Heuristic**  
   - This bias involves overestimating the importance of information that is readily available or recent. For instance, if a person can easily recall several airplane accidents, they might overestimate the risk of flying despite statistical evidence showing it's safe.

4. **Hindsight Bias**  
   - Also known as the "I-knew-it-all-along" effect, this bias makes people believe, after an event has occurred, that they had predicted or expected the outcome. This can lead to an overestimation of one's ability to predict events and a misunderstanding of the actual factors involved.

5. **Overconfidence Bias**  
   - This is the tendency to be more confident in one's abilities, knowledge, and predictions than is objectively warranted. Overconfidence can lead to risky decisions and a failure to adequately prepare for potential challenges.

6. **Self-Serving Bias**  
   - This bias involves attributing positive events to one's own actions and negative events to external factors. It can hinder personal growth and learning, as individuals may fail to recognize their own role in failures or mistakes.

7. **Framing Effect**  
   - The way information is presented (framed) can significantly affect decisions and judgments. For example, people might react differently to a product described as "90% fat-free" versus "10% fat," even though both descriptions are equivalent.

8. **Sunk Cost Fallacy**  
   - This bias leads individuals to continue an endeavor once an investment in money, effort, or time has been made, regardless of whether the current costs outweigh the benefits. It can result in staying in unproductive situations for too long.

9. **Status Quo Bias**  
   - This is the preference for the current state of affairs, and it leads to resistance to change. People tend to perceive any change from the baseline as a loss, which can prevent them from making beneficial changes.

10. **Groupthink**  
    - This occurs when the desire for harmony or conformity within a group results in irrational or dysfunctional decision-making. Group members suppress dissenting opinions, leading to a loss of critical thinking and poor outcomes.

Understanding these biases can help you recognize and mitigate their influence, leading to better reasoning, decision-making, and communication in both professional and personal contexts

Maybe sketches, visualizations that are refines fall under same process. Repetition, refinement, more clarity, more clear thoughts. The clearer the thoughts, the clearer the visuals.

Here from chatgpt:

The concept you are describing is closely related to several fields and concepts in cognitive science, communication theory, and design. Here are a few key terms and sciences that investigate and explain this process:

1. **Cognitive Load Theory**: This theory, developed by John Sweller, explores how human cognitive architecture handles information processing. It posits that learning is more effective when information is presented in a way that reduces unnecessary cognitive load, which aligns with the idea of refining and simplifying thoughts to enhance understanding and communication.

2. **Iterative Design**: In design fields, the iterative process involves repeated cycles of prototyping, testing, and refining a product or concept. This approach helps in gradually improving clarity and functionality, akin to refining thoughts or visualizations.

3. **Metacognition**: This is the awareness and understanding of one's own thought processes. Metacognition involves self-regulation of cognition through planning, monitoring, and evaluating, which can include refining and rephrasing thoughts for better clarity.

4. **Visual Thinking**: This is a way to organize your thoughts and improve your ability to think and communicate through visual means. Techniques such as mind mapping, sketching, and diagramming are used to clarify and simplify complex ideas.

5. **Information Design**: This field focuses on presenting information in a way that is most effective for understanding. It includes principles of clarity, simplicity, and the reduction of unnecessary complexity, often achieved through visual means.

6. **Clarity in Communication**: The process of rewriting or rephrasing thoughts to enhance clarity is a fundamental principle in communication studies. Techniques from this field are often employed to ensure messages are clear, concise, and effective.

These concepts collectively contribute to our understanding of how refining, rewriting, and redrawing ideas can enhance clarity and communication. They highlight the importance of iterative refinement and the role of clear presentation in effective information processing.
